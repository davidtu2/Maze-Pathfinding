How to Install/Run the Scripts

Prerequisites

1. This game was made using Python 3.6.4 (32-bit version) in a Win 10 system, so it is recommended you have Python 3.6.4 installed

2. Since the game uses the Pygame library, please make sure your version of Python has it as well. To check if you do, 
simply run Python and type “import pygame” in your IDLE. 
If there are no errors, that means you already have the library in your system. 
If you do receive an error, you will need to install the library. 
To install, simply go to your command prompt and type in the command: “pip install pygame”

Once those prerequisites are satisfied, extract the file, then click on the python file to run the program. 
Make sure that when you extract the file, it also includes the icons folder, since it contains all the sprites for the game to run. 
This folder should already be in the same directory as the python file.
